# React Web App UI for the Vinyl Tracker App

This is second version of the the Tracker App built with ReactJs. It functions as a simple tracker for me and my friend's vinyl record. It utilizes the Spotify API to pull meta data about individual records in the collection and will eventually incorporate a music playback feature for sharing favorite playlists/songs. 

A user can sign up and create an account and add/edit albums in their collection. There is a group feature under development where a user can create/join a group with other users and share their collection. 

The orignal purpose of the application was to ensure that several members who share albums between themselves do not accidently purchases two or more of the same album.
